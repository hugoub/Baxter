## README

This is a project using the baxter robot to generate some applications in the academic field.

## Content

The first app (juego_gato folder), it simulates the **tic-tac-toe** game between two players from 2 different computers.

In the second app (linea_de_produccion folder), Baxter is taking little pieces one by one through a feeder and it puts inside a box subdivide in *m x n* parts. Next, when the box is full, it picks the box up and carries to the full boxes place. Finally, it picks up an empty box from the empty boxes zone and it leaves it on the position to fill it again.

The installation instructions are in every folder.
